# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a full-stack personal task management app built using Next.js, Express, and MongoDB Atlas. It allows users to manage their daily tasks, track progress, and view insights through interactive charts.

This is my first project using Next.js and represents an important step in my web development journey. I'm continuing to enhance the app by adding new features and improvements over time.
